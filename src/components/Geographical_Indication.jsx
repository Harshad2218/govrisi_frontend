        <ol>
          <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> The applicant can be an individual, a group of individuals, or an organization representing producers of the goods in question.</li>
          <li><strong>Identification of the Product:</strong> Clearly identify the product for which GI registration is sought. It should have a unique quality, reputation, or characteristic attributable to its geographical origin.</li>
          <li><strong>Research:</strong> Conduct thorough research to ensure that the product meets the criteria for GI registration and is not already registered or in use by another entity.</li>
          <li><strong>Prepare the Application:</strong> Draft an application that includes:
            <ul>
              <li>The name of the Geographical Indication.</li>
              <li>A description of the product, including its qualities and reputation.</li>
              <li>The geographical area and details of the production process.</li>
              <li>Evidence of the uniqueness and traditional practices associated with the product.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>File the Application:</strong> Submit the application to the Geographical Indications Registry. This can be done online through the official website of the Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks. The application should include the prescribed fees (which may vary based on the type of applicant and the number of classes of goods).</li>
          <li><strong>Examination:</strong> After submission, the application will be examined by the GI Registry. The registrar may raise objections or require additional information.</li>
          <li><strong>Publication:</strong> If the application is accepted, it will be published in the Geographical Indications Journal. This allows other parties to oppose the registration if they have valid reasons.</li>
          <li><strong>Opposition:</strong> If any opposition is filed, a hearing will be conducted, and both parties will have the opportunity to present their cases.</li>
          <li><strong>Registration:</strong> If there are no oppositions, or if the opposition is resolved in favor of the applicant, the GI will be registered, and a certificate will be issued.</li>
          <li><strong>Renewal:</strong> The registration of a GI is valid indefinitely, but it must be renewed periodically, and the holder should ensure ongoing compliance with the conditions of the GI registration.</li>
        </ol>
